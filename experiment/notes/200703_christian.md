To discuss:

## Scanner wars 

 * Sylvia booked a lot of slots
 * "Preventive booking because of special subjects"
 * New rule: she books more than 4 weeks ahead, we book 2-4 weeks ahead.
 * She tries to keep people on the same date

 * Just did pilot with Miguel
 * Went reasonably well
 * Another pilot in 10 days (Monday 13th) -> Project Prop on 16th?!

 * Paradigm as it is now
 * Mapper (4 runs) + structural is 50 minutes without any break
 * 3 runs of task is ~ 45 minutes.

 * Proposal: we book 2.5 hours per subject, they have the option to go out of the scanner for 15-20 minutes. (Lydia and Sylvia do the same)

 *  Project proposal for 7T
 ** Practice next week/week after
 ** You need to sign something

 * HIWI:
	* Needed, definetly for 7T?  
	* Maybe Master's student?

 * Involve other researchers?
