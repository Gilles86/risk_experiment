 script has issues with ses- task- for trial design script

Mapper has to be only 126 volumes instead of 130?


END OF RUNS SHOULD BE FIXATION CROSS


Run and session seem conflated for logs of task?

Irma:
Unclear when trial starts
ISI too long
ITI shorter
Whole experiment too long
Insist on break?
Make clear that real money is on the line.
Make main task shorter (i.e., 6 runs (?))
Implement easy script to calculate payout
